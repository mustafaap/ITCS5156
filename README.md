This report proposes a novel approach to address data scarcity and privacy concerns in machine learning using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Leveraging existing research on DCGANs and conditional GANs, the method generates synthetic data while preserving privacy through adversarial training and regularization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance on benchmark datasets, highlighting the potential of my approach in various real-world applications. Future work may explore alternative loss functions and scalability to larger datasets, while considering ethical and privacy implications.
